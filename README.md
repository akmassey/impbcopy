# Alec Jacobson’s impbcopy and impbpaste

This repository contains copies of Alec Jacobson’s impbcopy and impbpaste
programs for copying and pasting images from the command line on macOS.  You
can read more about them in [his original blog post][1].

## Installing

I’ve created a (terribly) simple makefile.  You can use it by doing the
following:

    make install

Of course, you’ll probably want to read it beforehand.

## Related Projects

As Alec mentioned in his original post, you may want to use [pngpaste][2]
instead because it has more features than impbpaste.
